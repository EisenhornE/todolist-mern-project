# todolist-mern

This project is a somewhat a copy of Net Ninja's project that I followed to create my own "Todo List". 

#Status

This project is nearly complete. However, I have no plans to include authentication like in the Workout List tutorial as I plan to move on to learn Vite and Astro next.

#Packages 
In this project, I used the MERN stack.

MongoDB - MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. Instead of storing data in tables, like in traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in documents, which are JSON-like data structures with dynamic schemas. MongoDB allows for flexible and scalable database designs, with support for automatic sharding and replication for high availability and performance. It is commonly used in modern web applications, especially those that deal with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Express - Express is a popular, open-source web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and utilities for building web applications and APIs, including routing, middleware support, and a templating engine. Express simplifies the process of creating server-side logic and handling HTTP requests and responses, making it a powerful tool for building dynamic, scalable web applications. Express is widely used in the Node.js community and has a large ecosystem of plugins and extensions to support a variety of use cases.

React - React is a popular, open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, it enables developers to build complex and interactive UIs with reusable code components. React uses a declarative syntax to describe the structure of a UI, making it easy to reason about and test. It also has a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) implementation, which allows it to efficiently update the UI in response to changes in data or user interactions. React has become a widely adopted technology in the web development community, and is often used in combination with other tools and frameworks to build complex web applications.

NodeJS - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript. It was initially created by Ryan Dahl in 2009, and has since grown into a powerful tool for building scalable and efficient web applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle large numbers of simultaneous connections and requests. It also comes with a built-in package manager called npm (Node Package Manager) which makes it easy to install and manage third-party packages and libraries. With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript to build everything from web servers to command-line tools to desktop applications.

#Instructions 
I recommend that you follow Net Ninja's tutorial in installing the packages or read a documentation of the packages on how to install it.
